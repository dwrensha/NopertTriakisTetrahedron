# The checker model is the exact solid

For Nopert #76 the checker reads published decimals that only approximate the
exact solid, and certificate files budget for that error through
`exactApproximation` and `vertex_close_tight`.  The triakis tetrahedron has
exact rational vertices, so both statements hold with zero error.  We keep the
same interface, including the `tightVertexErrorQ` constant that the
certificate checkers (and their Python mirror) reserve, so the ported
certificate files need no changes.
