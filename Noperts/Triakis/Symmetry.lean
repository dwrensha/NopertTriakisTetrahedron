# The octahedral rotations and the triakis tetrahedron

The 24 rotation matrices that are signed permutations form the octahedral
rotation group `O`.  Indices `0..11` form the tetrahedral subgroup `T`,
which maps the solid onto itself; indices `12..23` form the coset `O \ T`,
each of which maps the solid onto its negative.  Index `0` is the identity
and indices `1,2,3` are the diagonal half-turns used as Cayley charts.

Everything here is exact rational data checked by `decide`.
