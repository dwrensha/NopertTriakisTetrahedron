This project formally proves that the 11/20 stellated tetrahedron
does not have the [Rupert property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_cube).
This polyhedron was [suggested by Tony Zeng](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.26531) as a candidate
for the simplest possible such "Nopert".
(It is not to be confused with the [triakis tetrahedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_tetrahedron),
which might alternately be referred to as the "3/5 stellated tetrahedron".)

Our main formal assertion is `¬ IsRupert exactVerts`, where `IsRupert` is the Mathlib-only definition in
[`Noperts/MainTheorem.lean`](Noperts/MainTheorem.lean) and `exactVerts` are the vertices
defined in [`Noperts/Stellated/Vertices.lean`](Noperts/Stellated/Vertices.lean).

This project grew out of the
[Noperthedron formalization](https://github.com/jcreedcmu/Noperthedron), and shares some of
its infrastructure.

## Structure of the proof

Our strategy is to subdivide the configuration space into many small regions
and then to prove that no Rupert passage exists for any of them.
The soundness of this strategy is formalized as `not_rupert_of_valid_table` and `not_rupert_of_root`
in [`IsNotRupert.lean`](Noperts/Stellated/IsNotRupert.lean).

The data of the subdivision lives in "pack" files (totalling about 1.2 GB, 121 MB compressed),
published as the release [`data-v1`](https://github.com/dwrensha/StellatedTetrahedron/releases/tag/data-v1);
`scripts/fetch_packs.sh` downloads them into `packs/` and verifies their checksums.

There are three different kinds of table holding the data.

* a chart table (`chart0.pack`): projective edge-cycle and balanced-triple certificates over
  a Cayley atlas of rotations;
* local tables (`local-NN.pack`): neighbourhoods of the symmetric poses;
* corner tables (`corner-*.pack`): blow-up coordinates around the corner views where the
  shadows touch at vertices.


## Getting started

[Install Lean](https://lean-lang.org/install/manual/), clone this project, then:

```
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

Run `lake exe cache get` first: it downloads prebuilt Mathlib, which `lake build` would
otherwise compile from source (several hours).


## Levels of trust

### Native proof

[`constructStellated`](constructStellated.lean) reads the certificate packs, checks them with
compiled code (trusting the Lean compiler, as `native_decide` does) and constructs the proof:

```
scripts/fetch_packs.sh
lake build constructStellated
.lake/build/bin/constructStellated packs
```

On a 16-core machine this takes about 35 minutes (about 8 CPU-hours).

### Kernel-only proof

The same certificates can be checked by the Lean kernel alone, with no trust in compiled code:
the resulting theorem `stellated_not_rupert_kernel : ¬ IsRupert exactVerts` depends only on
the standard axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

This uses integer and packed-`Nat` checkers that the kernel evaluates quickly
(`LocalKernel*`, `CornerKernel*`, `ChartKernel*`, `CornerAffTree`), each proved sound in
`Noperts/Stellated`, and generators that split the certificate data into kernel-checked
modules under `StellatedKernel/`:

| generator | output |
|---|---|
| [`chartKernelGen`](chartKernelGen.lean) | the chart table: 659 modules of `decide +kernel` chunks, and their assembly |
| [`localKernelGen`](localKernelGen.lean) | the 60 local tables, each split into slices checked in parallel |
| [`kernelCorner`](kernelCorner.lean) `ktreegen` | the 70 integer corner tables |
| [`cornerAffGen`](cornerAffGen.lean) | the corner tables that need an affine reparametrization |

To generate and check it:

```
scripts/fetch_packs.sh      # the certificate packs, into packs/
scripts/gen_kernel.sh       # the generated modules, into StellatedKernel/ (about 1–1.5 hours)
lake build StellatedKernel  # checks them (about 2.5 hours)
```

Each generated module stays within a few GB of memory, so Lake can check them all at full
parallelism: on a 16-core, 94 GB machine the whole kernel proof takes about 37 CPU-hours,
roughly 2 hours 25 minutes of wall-clock time. The generated modules are not checked in, and
`StellatedKernel` is not a default target (plain `lake build` builds only the library). They
load their data by repo-relative paths, so run `lake build StellatedKernel` from the repository
root. [`scripts/kernel_corner_tables.tsv`](scripts/kernel_corner_tables.tsv) lists the corner
tables with their roots and generators, and
[`scripts/gen_kernel_extra.py`](scripts/gen_kernel_extra.py) writes corner table 49 and the
final module `StellatedKernel/Main.lean`.

## Other contents

`checkStellatedRows`, `checkCornerPack`, `checkLocalPack`, `stellatedDryRun`, `compact*`,
`shareCorner` and `bench*Row` are tools for validating, compacting and profiling the
certificate tables.
